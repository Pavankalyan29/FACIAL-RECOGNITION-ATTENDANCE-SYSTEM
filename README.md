# Facial Recognition Attendance System
## Project Overview
A Python-based automated attendance system that uses **face recognition** to mark student attendance in real-time. The system captures faces via a webcam, compares them with a pre-registered database, and logs attendance in a **CSV file** with timestamps.
## Key Features
**âœ” Real-time face detection & recognition** using face_recognition and OpenCV
**âœ” Automated CSV logging** with date-wise attendance records
**âœ” Simple & efficient** â€“ Works with a webcam or any video input
**âœ” Customizable** â€“ Easily add/remove known faces
## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
***Python** (Primary language)
***OpenCV (cv2)** â€“ For video capture and image processing
***face_recognition** â€“ High-performance face detection & recognition
***NumPy** â€“ For numerical operations
***CSV module** â€“ For storing attendance records
